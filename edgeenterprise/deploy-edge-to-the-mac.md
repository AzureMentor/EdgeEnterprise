# Deploy to macOS

You can deploy Microsoft Edge for macOS using Microsoft Intune or Jamf.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 77 or later.

## Deploy Microsoft Edge for macOS using Microsoft Intune

You can deploy the Microsoft Edge .pkg installer as a line-of-business application using Microsoft Intune. This requires pre-processing the .pkg installer on a macOS device using the Intune App Wrapping Tool. The tool generates a .intunemac file that is uploaded to Microsoft Intune.

### Prerequisites

1. Download the [Intune App Wrapping Tool for macOS](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-wrapping-tool-mac). The tool must be run on a macOS device.

2. Mark the downloaded tool as an executable:

   - Start the Terminal app.
   - Change the directory to the location where `IntuneAppUtil` is located.
   - Run the following command to make the tool executable:<br>
     `chmod a+x ./IntuneAppUtil`
   - Test the tool by running: <br>
     `./IntuneAppUtil -h`

3. Use the `IntuneAppUtil` command to wrap the .pkg installer to a .intunemac file: <br>
   `./IntuneAppUtil -c MicrosoftEdgeDev-77.0.223.0.pkg -o <output_directory>`

To deploy Microsoft Edge for macOS using Microsoft Intune:

1. Sign in to [Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090973).
2. On the **Intune** pane, choose **Client apps** > **Apps** > **Add** > **Line-of-business app** > **App package file**.
3. On the **App package file** pane, choose the browse button, and select the wrapped Microsoft Edge installation file with the extension *.intunemac*. When you are finished, choose **OK**.
4. Configure app information. When you are finished, choose **OK**.
5. On the **Add app** pane, verify that the details for your app is correct.
6. Choose **Add**, to upload the app to Intune.
7. The app you have added is displayed in the apps list. You can now assign it to the groups you choose.

## Deploy Microsoft Edge for macOS using Jamf

You can automate deployment of Microsoft Edge for macOS using Jamf.

### Prerequisites for Jamf

Before you deploy Microsoft Edge, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- The Microsoft Edge installation file,  **MicrosoftEdgeDev-\<version\>.pkg** is in an accessible location on your network. You can download the Microsoft Edge Enterprise installation files from the [Microsoft Edge Enterprise landing page](https://aka.ms/EdgeEnterprise).
- You have a Jamf Cloud account with the level of access and privileges needed to create and deploy installation files to computers.
