# Frequently asked questions about Microsoft Edge in the enterprise

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 77 or later.

## How do I know which version of Microsoft Edge I have?
In the upper right corner of Microsoft Edge, click the ellipses icon (...), and then click Settings. Look in the About Microsoft Edge section to know your version.

## Will Internet Explorer 11 continue to receive updates?
We’re committed to keeping Internet Explorer a supported, reliable, and safe browser. Internet Explorer is still a component of Windows and follows the support lifecycle of the OS on which it’s installed. For details, see [Lifecycle FAQ - Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17454/). While we continue to support and update Internet Explorer, the latest features and platform updates will be available only in Microsoft Edge.

## Can I run the current version of Microsoft Edge side by side when I'm trying the new version?
Yes, you can. During the testing phase for the new version of Microsoft Edge, no changes will be made to the current version, and you will be able to continue using it. Additionally, each of the new Microsoft Edge channels are also supported side by side.

## Will favorites be ported over from the current version of Microsoft Edge or will I have to re-add?
Currently, Microsoft Edge supports import from existing installs of Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox (on Win10). The following settings are supported for importing: Bookmarks, History, Passwords and Autofill (Payments, addresses and generic forms). You can choose to import either from the First-run Experience or from browser settings.  

## What is the difference between the Canary and Developer channels/builds?
The Canary channel will update about daily, and the Dev channel will update about weekly. More information about other channels will be coming soon.

## What kind of extension support do I have with the new version of Microsoft Edge?
Microsoft Edge supports extensions from [Microsoft Edge Insider Addons](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081222) and [Chrome Web Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2072338).
