# Frequently asked questions about Microsoft Edge in the enterprise

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 77 or later.

## How do I know which version of Microsoft Edge I have?

In the upper right corner of Microsoft Edge, click the ellipses icon (**...**), and then click **Settings**. Select **About Microsoft Edge** to see your version of Microsoft Edge.

## Will Internet Explorer 11 continue to receive updates?

We’re committed to keeping Internet Explorer a supported, reliable, and safe browser. Internet Explorer is still a component of Windows and follows the support lifecycle of the OS on which it’s installed. For more information, see [Lifecycle FAQ - Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17454/). While we continue to support and update Internet Explorer, the latest features and platform updates will be available only in Microsoft Edge.

## Can I run the current version of Microsoft Edge side by side when I'm trying the new version?

Yes, you can. During the testing phase for the new version of Microsoft Edge, no changes will be made to the current version, and you will be able to continue using it. Additionally, each of the new Microsoft Edge channels are also support side by side testing.

## Will favorites be ported over from the current version of Microsoft Edge or will I have to re-add?

Currently, Microsoft Edge supports import from existing installs of Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox (on Win10). The following settings are supported for importing: Bookmarks, History, Passwords and Autofill (Payments, addresses and generic forms). You can choose to import either from the First-run Experience or from browser settings.  

## What's the difference between the Beta, Dev, and Canary channels/builds?

The Beta of the next version of Microsoft Edge is the most stable preview channel we offer, with enterprise-focused features ready for you to [pilot and evaluate](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/enterprise?form=MB1102&OCID=MB1102). The Beta channel will be updated approximately every six weeks. The Dev and Canary channels will continue to update weekly and daily respectively. Offline installers (MSIs and PKG files) are only available for the Beta and Dev channels.

## What kind of extension support do I have with the new version of Microsoft Edge?

Microsoft Edge supports extensions from [Microsoft Edge Insider Addons](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081222) and [Chrome Web Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2072338).

## Do you support Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Microsoft Intune?

Yes. Configuring Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 using Microsoft Intune and Mobile Device Management (MDM) is now supported. For more information, see [Configure Microsoft Edge using Microsoft Intune](configure-edge-with-intune.md) and [Configure Microsoft Edge using Mobile Device Management](configure-edge-with-mdm.md).
