# How to access the old version of Microsoft Edge after installing the new version

This article describes how access the old version of Microsoft Edge after the new version is installed.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Edge stable version 79 or later.

The procedures in this article apply to systems that have been updated with the latest security updates, up to and including November 2019. When the next version of Microsoft Edge is installed, the old version will be hidden. All attempts to launch the old version will  redirect the user to the newly installed version Microsoft Edge.

## Before you begin

Before using the detailed instructions in this article, consider the following 2 steps to enable a side-by-side browser experience. These steps will let your users run the current version of Microsoft Edge and the next version of Microsoft Edge (Beta channel) side-by-side.

1. Prevent the automatic install of the next version of Microsoft Edge by Windows Update. For more information, see [Windows Update: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12373/windows-update-faq)
2. Install the [Beta channel](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com) of the next version of Microsoft Edge.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This side-by-side solution is less complex and requires less management that the detailed solution described in this article.

## How operating system (OS) changes are triggered

After the systems are fully updated and the stable channel of the next version of Microsoft Edge is installed, the following registry key and value is set:

- Key: `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\ClientState\{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}`
- Key value: `BrowserReplacement`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This key is over-written every time the Microsoft Edge Stable channel is updated. As a best practice, we recommend that you donâ€™t delete this key to allow users to access both versions of Microsoft Edge.

## How to enable a side-by-side experience with both versions of Microsoft Edge

Installing the Stable channel of the next version of Microsoft Edge at system-level will cause the current version of Microsoft Edge to be hidden. If you want to let your users to see both versions of Microsoft Edge side-by-side in Windows, you can enable this experience by setting the **Allow Microsoft Edge Side by Side browser experience** group policy to "Enabled".

### To enable the side by side browser experience policy:

1. Open the Group Policy Editor.
2. Under **Computer Configuration**, go to *Administrative Templates>Microsoft Edge Update>Applications*.
3. Under **Applications**, select "Allow Microsoft Edge Side by Side browser experience" and then click Edit **policy setting**.
4. Select **Enabled** and then click **OK**.  

> [!NOTE]
> By default, this group policy is set to "Not configured", which results in the current version of Microsoft Edge being hidden when the next version of Microsoft Edge is installed.

For the best experience, the **Allow Microsoft Edge Side by Side browser experience** should be enabled before the next version of Microsoft Edge is deployed to your users' devices.

If the group policy is enabled after Microsoft Edge is deployed, there are the following side effects and required actions:

1. **Allow Microsoft Edge Side by Side browser experience** won't take effect until after the installer for the next version of Microsoft Edge is run again.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The installer can be run directly or automatically when the next version of Microsoft Edge updates.

2. The current version of Microsoft Edge will need to be re-pinned to Start or the Taskbar because the pin is migrated when the next version of Microsoft Edge was deployed.
3. Sites that were pinned to Start or the Taskbar for the current version of Microsoft Edge will be migrated to the next version of Microsoft Edge.
