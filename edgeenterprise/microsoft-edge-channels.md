# Overview of the Microsoft Edge channels

One of the benefits of the next version of Microsoft Edge is that Microsoft can provide new features on a regular basis. However, as the admin who deploys Microsoft Edge to the users in your organization, you might want to have more control over how often your users get these new features. Microsoft provides you four options, called channels, to control how often Microsoft Edge is updated with new features. Here's an overview of the four options.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 77 or later.

## Channel overview

|Channel|Primary purpose|How often updated with new features|Supported?|
|:---:|---|:---:|:---:|
|[Stable](#stable-channel)|Broad Deployment|~6 weeks|Yes|
|[Beta](#beta-channel)|Representative validation in the organization|~6 weeks|Yes|
|[Dev](#dev-channel)|Planning and developing|Weekly|No|
|[Canary](#canary-channel)||Daily|No|

The [Microsoft Edge Insider](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com) site provides access to the following Microsoft Edge Channels:

- The **Beta Channel** provides the most stable preview experience. This channel has major updates every 6 weeks. Each release incorporates learnings and improvements from the Dev and Canary builds.
- The **Dev Channel** represents improvements in the past week. These builds are tested by the Microsoft Edge team, and are generally more stable than Canary builds.
- The **Canary Channel** is refreshed and released automatically almost every night.
