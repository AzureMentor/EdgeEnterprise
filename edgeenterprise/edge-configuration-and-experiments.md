# Microsoft Edge configurations and experimentation

This article describes the interaction between Microsoft Edge and the Experimentation and Configuration service. Microsoft Edge communicates with this service to request and receive different kinds of payloads. These payloads can include configurations, feature rollouts and experiments, as well as settings for features and experiments.

> [!NOTE]
> This applies to Microsoft Edge version 77 or later.

## Configurations, Controlled Feature Rollout, and Experiments

Configurations are the payload meant to ensure product health, security, and privacy compliance, and are intended to have the same value for 100% of the audience. This could be to enable a feature flag such as domain actions, or to disable a feature flag in the event of a bug.

### Controlled Feature Rollout

Controlled Feature Rollout (CFR)

### Experiments

Microsoft Edge builds have features and functionality that are still in development or are experimental.
